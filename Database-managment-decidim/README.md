# Database-managment-decidim
Hello, this is my final career project. It's about an interface for managing data from the Canódrom de Barcelona. If you have an administrator account, it allows you to download, sort, and debug files of the activities carried out at the Canódrom. Additionally, based on the data from the downloaded activities, you can generate graphs for a single activity or multiple activities. These graphs can be customized with various features to adapt them to the current needs.

By slightly modifying the code, it can be adapted to any page administered with the "Decidim" platform.

For more information, please refer to decidim-database-managment.pdf or contact me directly.
